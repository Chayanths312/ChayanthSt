  biography: |
    Hi! I'm <strong>Chayanth Suthahar</strong>, a <em>Mechanical Engineering student</em> passionate about <em>design, manufacturing, and solving real-world problems through engineering</em>. I am currently studying at <em>Toronto Metropolitan University</em>, where I focus on mechanical design, fabrication, and applied problem-solving.
    With a background in <em>competitive robotics and community-led engineering initiatives</em>, I have developed strong interests in <em>mechanical design, manufacturing processes, and data-driven decision making</em>. I have contributed to large-scale engineering projects through <i>FIRST Robotics Team 2056</i> and founded <i>HammerHacks</i>, a high school hackathon focused on expanding access to STEM education.
    <div class="my-2"></div>
    Outside of engineering, I enjoy mentoring students, working on collaborative technical projects, and building solutions that make a tangible impact. Feel free to <a href="mailto:chayanthsuthahar@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reach out</a> to connect.
